      <description>This is a question that has been asked by literally thousands of programmers (and non-programmers) who are interested in programming. If you have an opinion, let us know.
The basic answer is: Of course it is!
The truth is, anyone can learn to program, you just need the right resources, and the right attitude.
The easiest programming language to learn is the language that you have a natural affinity for. Most programmers who are good at programming, learned a language or two by themselves.</description>
