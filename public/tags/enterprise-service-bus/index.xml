      <description>An Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) is a software system that provides connectivity between applications, services, and systems. An ESB is a core component of an SOA. An ESB provides an enterprise-wide, standardized, and scalable way for applications and components to communicate with each other. An ESB also provides a common set of protocols and standards that applications can use to communicate. An ESB can integrate disparate systems and technologies, such as legacy systems, mainframes, and web services.</description>
