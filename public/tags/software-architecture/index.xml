      <title>What is Services Oriented Architecture (SOA)?</title>

      <description>Service Oriented Architecture, or SOA, is a type of software design that focuses on creating reusable services. This approach to software design is intended to make life easier for developers, by providing them with building blocks that can be reused in different ways to create new applications.
In theory, SOA sounds like a great idea. However, in practice, it can be quite difficult to achieve. This is because different services need to be able to work together seamlessly in order for the overall system to function correctly.</description>

      <description>What are microservices? How do they relate to other architectures? Is the monolith vs. microservices question resolved? What are the downsides of using microservices architecture? Let&amp;rsquo;s get to it!
What are Microservices? Microservices, as defined by James Marten, are small units of software, built around a single business capability. These are typically encapsulated and self-contained. Each unit, even if it is very small, is completely reusable. A set of microservices is called a domain.</description>

      <description>Microservices architecture. Microservice architecture sounds a lot more complicated than it is. In simple terms, the architecture comprises small independent services that work closely together but ultimately fulfill a specific purpose. These services solve various software development problems through unique processes.
Microservices, or microservices architecture, is an approach to application development in which a large application is built from modular components or services. Each module supports a specific task or business goal and uses a simple, well-defined interface, such as an application programming interface (API), to communicate with other sets of services.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re a developer, then you&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard of RESTful APIs. But what are they, and why are they so popular?
In this blog post, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at what RESTful APIs are, and why they&amp;rsquo;re such a popular choice for developers. We&amp;rsquo;ll also explore some of the most common use cases for RESTful APIs.
Introduction to Restful APIs An API is an application programming interface. It is a set of rules that allow programs to talk to each other.</description>

      <title>What is Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)?</title>

      <description>An Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) is a software system that provides connectivity between applications, services, and systems. An ESB is a core component of an SOA. An ESB provides an enterprise-wide, standardized, and scalable way for applications and components to communicate with each other. An ESB also provides a common set of protocols and standards that applications can use to communicate. An ESB can integrate disparate systems and technologies, such as legacy systems, mainframes, and web services.</description>
