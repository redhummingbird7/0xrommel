      <description>What are microservices? How do they relate to other architectures? Is the monolith vs. microservices question resolved? What are the downsides of using microservices architecture? Let&amp;rsquo;s get to it!
What are Microservices? Microservices, as defined by James Marten, are small units of software, built around a single business capability. These are typically encapsulated and self-contained. Each unit, even if it is very small, is completely reusable. A set of microservices is called a domain.</description>

      <description>Microservices architecture. Microservice architecture sounds a lot more complicated than it is. In simple terms, the architecture comprises small independent services that work closely together but ultimately fulfill a specific purpose. These services solve various software development problems through unique processes.
Microservices, or microservices architecture, is an approach to application development in which a large application is built from modular components or services. Each module supports a specific task or business goal and uses a simple, well-defined interface, such as an application programming interface (API), to communicate with other sets of services.</description>
