      <description>What is agile methodology? The Agile methodology is a way to manage a project by breaking it up into several phases. It involves constant collaboration with stakeholders and continuous improvement at every stage. Once the work begins, teams cycle through a process of planning, executing, and evaluating. Continuous collaboration is vital, both with team members and project stakeholders.
Agile is a powerful mindset that simplified not only the world of software development, but is working for many times outside the IT sector.</description>
