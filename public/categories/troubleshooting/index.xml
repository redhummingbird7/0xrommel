      <description>Hope this can help someone going through a similar issue. Issue : I used MS Teams for meetings with colleagues and for some reason my Bluetooth headphone (Mpow H7) stopped working. I use it as speaker and there was just no sound coming out. It used to work before, so I&amp;rsquo;m not quite sure what went wrong. I&amp;rsquo;m suspecting some update could have change some setting or changed something.</description>
