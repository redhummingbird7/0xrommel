      <description>Prerequisites 1. You should have a Cloudflare account
If you don&amp;rsquo;t have one, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to register and it&amp;rsquo;s free to start. It does a have paid premium service but all of the Cloudflare services that we&amp;rsquo;ll use below are all free. 2. You should have already installed Hugo on your machine
Try to get the latest Hugo release. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t installed Hugo yet, check Hugo&amp;rsquo;s quick start guide to get started.</description>
