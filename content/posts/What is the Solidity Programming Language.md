The **Solidity language** is a programming language designed to create smart contracts. Smart contracts are a type of contract that can be used to create enforceable agreements between two or more parties. They are often used in the context of the [blockchain](https://0xrommel.dev/posts/what-is-blockchain-technology/), which is a distributed ledger of all cryptocurrency transactions. The programming language interacts with the **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)**, which is the abstraction layer between the executing code and execution machine.

It is based on current programming languages such as C++, [Python](https://0xrommel.dev/tags/python/), and JavaScript, hence it employs language patterns similar to those present in these languages, most likely to facilitate developer uptake. If you're a JavaScript or C++ developer, you'll recognize this.

Solidity is a new language that was created by [Ethereum](https://0xrommel.dev/posts/what-is-ethereum/). Gavin Wood first proposed Solidity in August 2014. The language was then developed by the Ethereum project's Solidity team, which was directed by Christian Reitwiessner, Alex Beregszaszi, and numerous former Ethereum core members. Solidity is used to create contracts that are used on the Ethereum network.

## Is Solidity easy to learn?

The Solidity language is **NOT difficult** to learn for those with experience in programming. It is a Turing-complete language, which means that it can be used to create any type of program. The Solidity language is also statically typed, which means that variables must be declared with a specific type.

Is the Solidity language easy to learn? Any person with basic programming knowledge can start coding in Solidity. The syntax of Solidity is very similar to that of JavaScript. That being said, it does take some time to get used to the different concepts involved in writing a smart contract.

The Solidity language is designed to be easy to learn for programmers who are already familiar with other languages. However, it is still a new language and there are some things that can be confusing for new programmers.

## Is Solidity similar to Python?

The programming language Solidity is very different from Python. While both languages can be used to create smart contracts, Solidity was designed specifically for the Ethereum blockchain. Python is a general-purpose programming language that can be used for a wide variety of tasks. Solidity is a contract-oriented, statically typed language with inheritance, libraries, and user-defined types.

It is specifically used to build smart contracts of any type (ex: crowdfunding, blind auctions, voting, multi-signature crypto wallets etc.). And, as mentioned earlier, smart contracts are the main reason for Solidity's existence. A smart contract is essentially a collection of code and data that lives at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Is it worth learning Solidity?

The answer to whether it is worth learning Solidity depends on your career goals. If you want to work in the cryptocurrency industry, then it is probably worth your time to learn Solidity. However, if you are not interested in working in the cryptocurrency industry, then you may not find Solidity to be as useful.

## What are the important concepts to learn in Solidity?

The important concepts in Solidity are: classes, interfaces, libraries, and inheritance. These concepts are important because they allow for the creation of more complex smart contracts. Inheritance, in particular, allows for the reuse of code and the creation of more modular contracts.

It may be used to build smart contracts for voting, crowdfunding, blind auctions, multi-signature crypto wallets, and other applications. And smart contracts are the main reason for Solidity's existence. A smart contract is essentially a collection of code and data that lives at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Where can I learn more about Solidity?

If you are interested in learning more about the Solidity language, there are a few places to start. The first place to look is the [Solidity website](https://soliditylang.org/). This website provides a comprehensive overview of the language and includes tutorials that will teach you how to code in Solidity. Alternatively, you can explore the [Ethereum blockchain](https://ethereum.org/en/) and find contracts that you can understand.
