## OOP (Object Oriented Programming)

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of objects, or modules, to create self-sufficient software applications. OOP is seen as a way of reducing the redundancy and coupling in code, and it has become the most popular programming approach in recent years.

The basic concepts of object-oriented programming are that objects are self-sufficient modules of code. These modules can be reused throughout the application, which reduces redundancy and the amount of code that needs to be written. Additionally, OOP promotes code modularity, which means that code can be divided into smaller, more manageable pieces.

## Benefits of OOP (Object Oriented Programming)

The benefits of OOP are many. One of the most important is code reusability. Objects can be created once and reused throughout the code, which reduces the amount of code that needs to be written and makes for more efficient software development. OOP also promotes code modularity, which means that code can be divided into smaller, more manageable pieces.

## Who created OOP?

There are many different answers to this question. Some say that OOP was created by the designers of the C++ programming language, while others say that it was originally created in the 1970s by a man named Alan Kay. The most commonly accepted answer is that OOP was created by a team of individuals who worked on the C++ programming language in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

## OOP vs Procedural Languages

OOP is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of objects, or modules, to create self-sufficient software applications. OOP is seen as a way of reducing the redundancy and coupling in code, and it has become the most popular programming approach in recent years.

Procedural languages, on the other hand, are not as object-oriented. They don't use objects, and instead rely on procedures to control the flow of execution within the program.

## Some example OOP programming languages

Some of the most popular OOP programming languages include Java, C++, and Python. These languages are all based on the concept of objects and use the same basic principles of OOP. OOP languages are easy to learn and use, and they can be used to create software that is more efficient and easier to maintain.
