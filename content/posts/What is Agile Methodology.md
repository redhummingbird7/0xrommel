## What is agile methodology?

The Agile methodology is a way to manage a project by breaking it up into several phases. It involves constant collaboration with stakeholders and continuous improvement at every stage. Once the work begins, teams cycle through a process of planning, executing, and evaluating. Continuous collaboration is vital, both with team members and project stakeholders.

Agile is a powerful mindset that simplified not only the world of software development, but is working for many times outside the IT sector. The key to a satisfactory Agile implementation is everyone being on the same page, and not being afraid to make mistakes. They are going to happen either way, but the change happens if you are able to spot them fast. It’s easier in a team than it is on your own.

## What are the benefits of using an agile methodology?

One of the greatest benefits of agile methods is the ability to manage changing priorities. With agile’s iterative approach and emphasis on continuous feedback, you can get the data you need during the development process, not after, allowing the team to make more impactful choices based on actual conditions, not just predicted conditions.

**Better Quality:** Because it is iterative, one big benefit of agile methodology is the ability to find problems and create solutions quickly and efficiently. The flexibility of the agile method allows project teams to respond to customer reaction and constantly improve the product.

## What are some common challenges with agile methodology?

Companies should also customize their approaches to tailor to their organizational and project needs. Another factor to consider while implementing the Agile methodology is the employees’ acceptance. They need to be willing to adopt the changes as well, and if the practices do not suit them, this may become a big challenge across the enterprise.

To limit the potential disadvantages of Agile, you should research your preferred Agile project management framework thoroughly before implementing it in your organization. If you already use an Agile framework, consider the question posed by professional services firm Deloitte: “How fragile is your Agile?” Document your existing pain points and brainstorm ways to strengthen your future Agile projects.
