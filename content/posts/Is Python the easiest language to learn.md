This is a question that has been asked by literally thousands of programmers (and non-programmers) who are interested in programming. If you have an opinion, let us know.

The basic answer is: **Of course it is!**

The truth is, anyone can learn to program, you just need the right resources, and the right attitude.

The easiest programming language to learn is the language that you have a natural affinity for. Most programmers who are good at programming, learned a language or two by themselves. As a matter of fact, many of them were initially self-taught. It is a process of acclimatisation, of learning and becoming a new creature.

That said, there are certain programming languages that are easier to learn and there are others that are harder to learn.

## How to evaluate a programming language?

Here’s what to look for when trying to evaluate a language as a good programming language:

First thing to check is its features. This includes the number of features that the language supports, along with their ease of use. It will also include things like the object orientation model supported, the built-in collections, and other things that relate to the object oriented nature of the language.

Some languages just have different names for a concept. You’d know a language is object oriented because you’d see the O in the language’s name, or its keywords or it’s syntax. For example, you’d say that PHP is a procedural language when you see the word ‘procedural’ in its name. You would say that the same language is OOP when you see the O in the name.

There are programming languages that support many concepts, but the concept that is actually important to them is just OOP. And there are programming languages that support other concepts, but not OOP.

A good language should make you feel excited, and not frustrated with the concepts that are being taught to you. They should make you excited about learning more and seeing more in them.

To make it simple, I’d recommend having one or two programming languages. There are plenty of resources to learn more than one, and in fact I recommend having two or more, and one or two that are more advanced, respectively.

Once you’ve chosen your language, you have to decide how you would like to learn it, how much time and effort you want to put into it. I’d say, don’t get discouraged by the amount of effort it’ll require.

## Is Python really the easiest programming language to learn?

Absolutely yes! I’ve learned several languages in the last two decades. C and C++, Assembly and many more. Here are my thoughts on some of them, and why I like Python:

Python is a scripting language, and so is easy to learn. I can write a small script in less than 5 minutes and understand how it works in 10-15 minutes. That’s my experience.

Python is OOP oriented. Its features like classes, objects, methods, and properties make it easy to follow the OOP model. I’ve been programming in languages that don’t support OOP models. So when I first tried Python, it was easy for me to understand and build apps.

Python uses white spaces instead of braces to define a code block. It is easy to read the code and understand what it does.

Python is powerful. In fact, a lot of the features that are part of OOP, can be achieved with a few simple features of Python. But you have to learn them and learn them well.

So if you want to learn a programming language, start with Python, because it’s an easy language to learn, and has a lot of learning that can be done. After Python, you can move on to C or C++ if you really want to learn, and if you like C, C++ is another great programming language to learn.

In my personal experience, Python was a refreshing and wonderful experience. My journey started with it, and I’m still learning from it.

## Why it’s the best programming language for beginners:

It is easy to learn.

It’s scripting language.

It supports OOP.

It supports many concepts in general.

It’s a powerful language.

You can learn Python in less than 10 minutes, there are lots of good videos in Youtube you can watch.

It’s a scripting language, so you can do and do things in your editor or any terminal.

## Conclusion

So if you’re looking for an easy programming language to start with, Python is a definitely good choice.
