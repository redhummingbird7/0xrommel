## Microservices architecture.

Microservice architecture sounds a lot more complicated than it is. In simple terms, the architecture comprises small independent services that work closely together but ultimately fulfill a specific purpose. These services solve various software development problems through unique processes.

Microservices, or microservices architecture, is an approach to application development in which a large application is built from modular components or services. Each module supports a specific task or business goal and uses a simple, well-defined interface, such as an application programming interface (API), to communicate with other sets of services.

## Microservices development.

The first rule of microservices is, don’t build microservices: Stated more accurately, don’t start with microservices. Microservices are a way to manage complexity once applications have gotten too large and unwieldly to be updated and maintained easily. Only when you feel the pain and complexity of the monolith begin to creep in is it worth considering how you might refactor that application into smaller services. Until you feel that pain, you don’t even really have a monolith that needs refactoring.

Microservices are the future of software development. This approach serves as a server-side solution to development where services remain connected but work independently from each other. More developers are using microservices to improve performance, precision, and productivity, and analytical tools provide them with valuable insights about performance and service levels.

## How microservices improve software delivery.

Microservices enable continuous integration and continuous delivery, making it easy to try out new ideas and to roll back if something doesn’t work. The low cost of failure enables experimentation, makes it easier to update code, and accelerates time-to-market for new features.

Microservices are not a silver bullet, and by implementing them you will expose communication, teamwork, and other problems that may have been previously implicit but are now forced out into the open. But API Gateways in Microservices can greatly reduce build and QA time and effort.
